            <h1>Colorado Trip January 2025</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my photo gallery from my recent trip to Colorado in January 2025. This is one of my favorite trips ever, and I wanted some sort of way to remember it. So I made this website!</p>

        <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
        <!--Image of snowfall-->
        <p>If you want to see snow in Colorado, you most definitely will see it. Even if it doesn't snow in the city, you can drive to the mountains to find it!
        Although, January isn't exactly the best time to visit Colorado for snow, as March is the snowiest month in most areas! You will see some snowfall in January,
        but it may not be as much as in February or March. Be prepared for the cold, January may not be the snowiest, but is is the coldest. So make sure to wear layers to keep yourself warm, especially if you arent used to the cold.</p>
        <!--Image of us skiing/excersizing-->
        <p>Also, stay hydrated! The altitude in Colorado can be quite high, and it's very dry. It's easy very to get dehydrated, especially when engaging in outdoor activities like hiking or skiing. The high altitude can also make it harder to breathe, give headaches, and get you lightheaded. So take it easy and drink plenty of water if you're not used to it. In my experience, after 1-2 days the altitude sickness goes away (in the city at least).</p>
        <!--Image of us at the top of Pikes Peak-->
        <p>Finally, if you plan to hike up any mountains with high altitude (10k feet or more) again, make sure to drink PLENTY of water and/or bring some canned oxygen. My group went to the top of Pikes Peak to the visitors center, and the altitude sickness was severe due to the altitude (14k feet!). Also, the tempuratures up there can get way below zero, when we went there the wind chills were -28F! The views from the top are very worth the trouble though!</p>
